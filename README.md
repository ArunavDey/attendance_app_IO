# Attendance App for PESU IO
Welcome to the Attendance app for the PESU IO Course "Introduction to Blockchain and Decentralized Applications"! For most of you, this will be the first DApp you interact with. Follow the instructions and together we will learn how it works!

## Make sure you have everything installed!
Go through the [installation instructions](https://github.com/srujandeshpande/attendance_app_IO/blob/master/installations.md) and make sure you've got everything set.

## Clone the Repo
If you have git, clone this repo. If you don't have git, download the zip.

## Navigate to the downloaded/cloned repository
Do this on command line (terminal or command prompt)

## Go inside the folder
You should be inside the folder `attendance_app_IO`

## (ONLY FOR LINUX/MAC)
Rename `truffle-config.js` to `truffle.js`

Go into the src folder

Rename `App.js` to `app.js`

Get back to the `attendance_app_IO` folder

## Installing Node Modules
Run the command `npm install`.
This might take a while.
